  - Text input (Name)
  - Email input
  - Date picker (Date of Birth)
  - Phone number with validation pattern
  - Country selector using datalist
  - Rating dropdown with abbreviation tooltips
  - Radio buttons and checkboxes

- Uses HTML5 attributes: required, placeholder, pattern, autocomplete

Usage:
------
1. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
2. Fill in the required fields marked with "*".
